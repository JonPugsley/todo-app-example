## Instructions

There are 3 things that need to be fixed in this application.

1. Creating a new item has no effect. Take a look at the browser console to determine why.
2. When a existing item is updated, the change doesn't persist in the database. Take a look at the server logs
   to determine what's wrong.
3. A completed item should have a strike through the text. You can accomplish this through CSS.

The server side code that should interest you is in app/controllers
The frontend application code is located in app/javascript/src
The frontend stylesheet is located in app/javascript/src/stylesheet.css
