## Instructions

There are 3 things that need to be fixed in this application.

1. Creating a new item has no effect.
2. When a existing item is updated, the change doesn't persist in the database.
3. A completed item should be styled with a strikethrough.

The server side code that should interest you is in app/controllers.

The frontend application code is located in app/javascript/src.
